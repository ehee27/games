The goal should be functional movement. This will also greatly reduce your risk of 2 out of the 3 risk largest risk factors you face: heart disease and diabetes.\n\nOther serious risk factors for men your age include cancer, influenza, and pneumonia. If you have any kind of respiratory issues affecting you such as asthma or COPD this is more concerning for you and your level of caution around this should be higher. If you smoke, the best thing you can do for yourself is stop. 90% of cases of lung cancer result from smoking, and it's not too late for you no matter your age.\n\nLesser known but important issues for men your age are oral health and depression. Oral health has been strongly linked with good cardiovascular health and less risk for infection.
